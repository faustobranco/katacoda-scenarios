# How lambda works.

Copy the code and execute in the terminal on the side.


The lambda expression can also be "stored" in a variable, and have the same behavior as a function.
Although this type of approach is not very usual and does not make much sense, as it is much more natural to use a function in these cases, the demonstration below is just to illustrate how it works.

	lmb_Example = lambda x: x + 1

	print(lmb_Example(5))
